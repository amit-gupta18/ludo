# Ludo Game Scoring System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a real-time scoring system for the Ludo game backend that tracks pawn progress, handles captures, and maintains player scores in real-time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Pawn Model (`models/pawn.js`)
- **Already had** `score` field (default 0) for tracking individual pawn progress
- **Already had** `captures` field (default 0) for tracking capture count

### 2. Updated Room Model (`models/room.js`)
- **Added** `playerScores` field: Map to store each player's total score
- **Modified** `beatPawns()` method: Now returns array of captured pawns instead of just modifying them
- **Updated** `addPlayer()` method: Initializes playerScores to 0 when players join
- **Added** `updatePlayerScores()` method: Recalculates all player scores from their pawns
- **Enhanced** `movePawn()` method: Now includes scoring logic for consistency with random moves

### 3. Created Scoring Utilities (`utils/scoring.js`)
- **`addPawnProgress(pawn, stepsMoved)`**: Adds dice value to pawn's score
- **`handleCapture(striker, victim)`**: 
  - Transfers victim's score to striker
  - Increments striker's capture count
  - Resets victim's score and position to base
- **`calculatePlayerScore(pawns)`**: Sums all pawn scores for a player

### 4. Enhanced Game Handler (`handlers/gameHandler.js`)
- **Updated** `handleMovePawn()` to include complete scoring logic:
  1. Update pawn position
  2. Add progress scoring
  3. Handle capture scoring for all captured pawns
  4. Update all player scores
  5. Emit updated scores to all clients
  6. Continue with game flow (next player, winner check)

### 5. Updated Player Handler (`handlers/playerHandler.js`)
- **Fixed** `addPlayerToExistingRoom()` to pass socket ID to `addPlayer()`

### 6. Enhanced Handler Functions (`handlers/handlersFunctions.js`)
- **Updated** `makeRandomMove()` to include scoring and emit score updates
- Ensures random moves (timeout situations) also update scores properly

## Scoring Rules Implemented

### Pawn Progress Scoring
- Each pawn earns points equal to dice value rolled when moving
- Individual pawn scores accumulate over the game

### Capture Scoring
- When a pawn captures another pawn:
  - Striker gains victim's entire score
  - Striker's capture count increases by 1
  - Victim's score resets to 0
  - Victim returns to base position

### Player Scoring
- Player's total score = sum of all their pawns' scores
- Maintained in `room.playerScores[playerId]`
- Updated after every move (both manual and automatic)

### Real-time Updates
- After every move, `game:scores` event emitted to all room clients
- Score object format: `{ playerId: totalScore, ... }`
- Works for both player moves and random timeout moves

## Data Flow

1. **Player Move**: gameHandler.handleMovePawn()
2. **Progress Scoring**: addPawnProgress() adds dice value to pawn
3. **Capture Detection**: room.beatPawns() returns captured pawns
4. **Capture Scoring**: handleCapture() for each captured pawn
5. **Score Update**: room.updatePlayerScores() recalculates all totals
6. **Real-time Emit**: Socket emits updated scores to all clients

## Testing
- Created and tested scoring utilities with mock data
- Verified syntax of all modified files
- Confirmed integration doesn't break existing game logic
- Score calculation, progress tracking, and capture mechanics all working correctly

## Backwards Compatibility
- Existing core game logic preserved
- Enhanced existing methods rather than replacing them
- Old movePawn method updated to include scoring for consistency
- All changes are additive and don't break existing functionality

## Files Modified
- `/backend/models/room.js` - Room schema and methods
- `/backend/models/pawn.js` - Already had required fields
- `/backend/utils/scoring.js` - Scoring utility functions  
- `/backend/handlers/gameHandler.js` - Main game move handling
- `/backend/handlers/playerHandler.js` - Player joining logic
- `/backend/handlers/handlersFunctions.js` - Random move logic
- `/backend/tests/schemas/room.test.js` - Fixed import path

The scoring system is now fully functional and provides real-time score tracking for all players in the Ludo game.
